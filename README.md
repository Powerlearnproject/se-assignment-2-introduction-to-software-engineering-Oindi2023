# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: It involve the deliberate crafting prompt to artificial intelligence model to influence their output

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? software  purely deals with creating program while programming deals with writing code. the difference come in that software is extended to the lifestyle cycle and maintenance unlike programming
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): deals with building series of end product step by step iorder to meet user's technical preference

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.1] planing - it defineproject scope . 2] requirement -defining functional and tecnical requirement . 3] Design -you design what is needed [Hld]  
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:Agile emphysize on flexibility,collaboration and customer feedback while waterfall is linearly and sequential approach ineach and every stage

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering: Agile is collaboration unlike waterfall model which is more of sequence  
both are important in software development 
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. 1] User requirement,this has the end user need.2] System requirement it must be in lign with the system need.3] Business requirement it shoulg a chieve business need 
Software Design Principles:1]Traceable to analysi model.  2]should not suffer from tunnel vision. 3] Should accommodate changes

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? Modularity aimed at creating in a way that minimizes dependencies a mong other other component .it can be minimize by putting the problem into manageable form 
Testing in Software Engineering:It involve proving the system key element software,hardware,document ,data ant how people interact with it

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing)  . Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
